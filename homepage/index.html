    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Metapixel is a program for generating
      <a href="http://www.photomosaic.com/">photomosaics</a>. It can
      generate classical photomosaics, in which the source image is
      viewed as a matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which
      a matching image is substitued, as well as collage-style
      photomosaics, in which rectangular parts of the source image at
      arbitrary positions (i.e. not aligned to a matrix) are
      substituted by matching images.

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Metapixel generates not only classical mosaics but also collage-style
        photomosaics (see <a href="examples.html">examples</a>).

      <li>The matching algorithms matches not only color but also form.

      <li>Metapixel is fast. It takes about 75 seconds to generate a classical
        photomosaic for a 2048x2432 image with constituent images of size 64x64
	and a database of slightly more than 11000 images on my not-so-fast
	Alpha. Most of this time is spent loading and saving images.

      <li>Metapixel can be instructed to honor a minimum distance between two
        occurrences of the same image in classical photomosaics.

      <li>Metapixel is a command-line program and thus scriptable.
    </ul>
