    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Metapixel is a program for generating
      <a href="http://www.photomosaic.com/">photomosaics</a>. It can
      generate classical photomosaics, in which the source image is
      viewed as a matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which
      a matching image is substitued, as well as collage-style
      photomosaics, in which rectangular parts of the source image at
      arbitrary positions (i.e. not aligned to a matrix) are
      substituted by matching images.

    <h2>Legal Conditions</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Metapixel is free software distributed under the terms of the
      <a href="../COPYING">GNU General Public Licence</a>. Due to the
      inclusion of <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/">Paul
      Heckbert</a>'s wonderful image scaling code in version 0.3, the
      additional restriction that it may only be used for peaceful,
      nonprofit purposes is placed on Metapixel. I have already contacted
      Paul Heckbert regarding the removal of this restriction.
