    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Metapixel is a program for generating
      <a href="http://www.photomosaic.com/">photomosaics</a>. It can
      generate classical photomosaics, in which the source image is
      viewed as a matrix of equally sized rectangles for each of which
      a matching image is substitued, as well as collage-style
      photomosaics, in which rectangular parts of the source image at
      arbitrary positions (i.e. not aligned to a matrix) are
      substituted by matching images.

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Metapixel generates not only classical mosaics but also collage-style
        photomosaics (see <a href="http://metapixel.nix.at/metapixel/examples.html">examples</a>).

      <li>The matching algorithms match not only color but also form.

      <li>Metapixel is fast. It takes about 75 seconds to generate a classical
        photomosaic for a 2048x2432 image with constituent images of size 64x64
	and a database of slightly more than 11000 images on my not-so-fast
	Alpha. Most of this time is spent loading and saving images.

      <li>Metapixel can generate classical mosaics which contain at
        most one copy of each constituent image.  Alternatively,
        Metapixel can be instructed to honor a minimum distance
        between two occurrences of the same image in classical
        photomosaics.

      <li>Metapixel has a cheat option which overlays the photomosaic
        with the original image using a user-specified
        percentage. Small percentages yield noticable improvements but
        are innocent enough so as not to be noticed without close
        inspection.

      <li>Metapixel is a command-line program and thus scriptable.
    </ul>

    <h2>News</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p><b>01-15-2004</b> Released version 0.8.

      <blockquote>
        Introduces a new search method which guarantees that no small
        image is used more than once in a mosaic.  A new feature
        called "antimosaic" has been addes which is probably useless.
        Metapixel can now write the layout of a mosaic to a text file
        and read that file again to reproduce the mosaic.  Compiles on
        MacOS X with Fink.
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>01-21-2000</b> Released version 0.7.

      <blockquote>
        Memory requirements for creating classical photomosaics have
        been lowered tremendously in this version. Also, this version
        features a new option for scaling the input image (thanks to
        Osku Salerma).
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>01-15-2000</b> Released version 0.6. 

      <blockquote>
        This version features a new image matching metric which is
        actually an implementation of a trivial distance metric: the
        constituent image to be compared to and the subimage to be
        compared are both scaled to a size of 5x5 pixels and the sum
        of the distances of their pixels is used as the score, with
        lower scores meaning a better match.
      </blockquote>

      <p><b>01-09-2000</b> Released version 0.5.

      <p><b>01-06-2000</b> Released version 0.4.

    <h2>Legal Conditions</h2>

    <blockquote>
      Metapixel is free software distributed under the terms of the <a

      inclusion of <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/">Paul
      Heckbert</a>'s wonderful image scaling code in version 0.3 and
      above, the additional restriction that it may only be used for
      peaceful, nonprofit purposes is placed on Metapixel. I have
      already contacted Paul Heckbert regarding the removal of this
      restriction.
