implement classic mosaics with nonstandard tiling, i.e., triangles and
hexagons.

implement masks for collages

implement larger tiles

TEST: everything from the start: prepare, then do mosaics of all
kinds.

DONE:

metapixel should check whether it can open the small images, otherwise
the output image is garbage !!!!!!!!!!!!

metapixel-prepare should check if it can really run metapixel (if it's
in path).

garble input image, i.e. take small images directly from input image.
make sure that no small image takes the place it had in the original
image.

metapixel should be able to process files with spaces.  (cannot read
tables file).

better (and much slower) image generation: for each metapixel
location, compute score of each small image.  then, do the following
until all locations have metapixels: search for the highest score of
an unused image in a location not yet given away, and use that image
in that location.

allow more than one tables file
