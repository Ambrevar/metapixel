* 1.2.0

make wavelet work again

test suite

* 1.2.1

use multiple threads for mosaic creation (create thread library to
unify with mathmap)

make zoom multi-threaded, too

use multiple threads/processes for preparation - give multiple image
arguments to metapixel --prepare

filter for small images based on aspect ratio (and do all other
filtering there, too).  for generating mosaics as well as for adding
images to libraries.

filter for adding images to libraries based on similarity to other
images.

honor image orientation in EXIF data (esp in JPEGs) - use libexif

flipping in metapixel-prepare

check all asserts

Document flipping (?)

Fix the FIXMEs

***

for 0.11:

debian package: http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?searchon=names&version=all&release=all&keywords=metapixel

***

document batch mode

implement classic mosaics with nonstandard tiling, i.e., triangles and
hexagons.

implement masks for collages

implement larger tiles

TEST: everything from the start: prepare, then do mosaics of all
kinds.

DONE:

metapixel should check whether it can open the small images, otherwise
the output image is garbage !!!!!!!!!!!!

metapixel-prepare should check if it can really run metapixel (if it's
in path).

allow more than one tables file
